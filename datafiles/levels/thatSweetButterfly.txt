@t@ha/t`1`/ \sweet`2`\ butterfly
floa/t`2`/ing gracefully, \suspended`1`\ in cold blue hues.
a slow, delicate dance so pleasant, yet
each beat precedes the invisible maelstrom,
turbulent currents flow vicious and fast
a constricting panic that won't stop,
mustn't stop,
              I don't want it to
 
 My flurried heart,
  strained and spalling
   the crux of existence fracturing unrestrained.
   i hate this comfortable annihilation, unbidden
  now routine and recurrent
 pulse vehement, harmonised, infinite
 
that sweet butterfly,
wings kissing air like a shallow breath.
an air indifferent and unaware until pierced
    sliced
ripped apart by a quickened beat unkind and
pounding, a tempest, a stillness broken, and
an atmosphere agitated and aflame with apprehension
 
that sweet butterfly
                     passes.
as hastily as it arrived
the disqu|i|et is gone
mere suggestions of turmoil in serenity.
the air settles to an apathy again
